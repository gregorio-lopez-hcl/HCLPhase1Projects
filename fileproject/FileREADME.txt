This file read, write, and append project is centered around the main method under the MakingAWarrior.java file. 
The main method calls all other public methods listed in the "fileproject" folder. 

The purpose or frame work for my project was to simulate a user creating a warrior class character in a video game. Thus,
why the file names all have the corresponding "warrior" moniker.
