This is a program to find the largeset increasing subsequence among a user set size ArrayList. It will accept user integer input and create an array to meet that capacity integer
and then assign random elements to said array. It will then iterate through created array until it finds the longest increasing sub-sequence. 

*Note: The program will print out both the index positions of the beginning and ending values in the sub-sequence, in addition to printing the contents of the sub-sequence itself.
*Also, if two sub-sequences are tied in length it returns the first found sub-sequence.
